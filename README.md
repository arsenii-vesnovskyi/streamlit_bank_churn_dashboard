# streamlit_bank_churn_dashboard

**Project Description**

This prototype provides the tool to explore the bank churn dataset through pre-defined and interactive visualizations, as well as to download the dataset in the needed format to deploy it in the third-party tools. It also allows the users to see the performance and the most important features for the trained AI model and make predictions for the characteristics that the user inputs through the app. Finally, the user can select any customer from the dataset and explore how the adjustments of the specific features of that customer changes the probability of it to churn, which provides a good tool for scenario analysis.
